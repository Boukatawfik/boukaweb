                    In this project , i was having a poject in college for making an animation  movie .
                    As movie should have some posters so this was 2 posters of my movie with the same 
                    typography and my the main character with 2 diffrent splitted background and this was one . 
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when 
                    an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of 
                    Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
                    software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
